# Canvas Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for creating JavaScript 2D games using the canvas html element.

## MyGame.js

This is the main file to be used. Create all your objects here; update them and draw them here. In the constructor you can change the canvas width and height by setting this.canvas.width and this.canvas.height.

## Game.run()

This is where the loop takes place. It calls update(deltaTime) and draw(context). "deltaTime" is the completion time in milliseconds since the last frame. "context" is the canvas 2D context.

## Live Server Extension

Install Live Server extension. You'll need it in order to import files. Once installed, right click on "index.html" and click on "Open with Live Server".

## Updates

There will be more updates such as Screen Manager.
